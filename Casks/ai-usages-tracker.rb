  # The app is ad-hoc signed but not Apple-notarized (no paid Developer
  # account). macOS Sequoia blocks quarantined ad-hoc binaries by default.
  # Stripping the quarantine attribute after install lets the app launch
  # cleanly — safe because the user explicitly opted in by running `brew install`.
